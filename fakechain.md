Let's decouple cryptographic signatures from the consensus.
In many cases, the application needs sig, not the consensys.

Blockchain, or Satoshi consensus, is to reach agreement on the ordering (including exisitence) of events (with a good world clock).

The signature scheme is to prevent someone from denying what it has committed when signing the document.

If some state is read-only, you don't need blockchain to store it. Instead, a cloud storage service or IPFS like system is sufficient.

Case I: You have signed an agreement contract with the company, which can not be cancelled within some period.
Such state never changes over time.
All you need is to co-sign this contract with the company and store it somewhere.
When you need it, you only need to show it or show the posession of it with some properties proved in some way.
With the signature collected, no one can deny your acknowledgement of the terms.
The receipt, or credential, is sufficient here.
Even some other program want to read the state (for the so called interoperability), it can be provided via storage proofs.

Case II: Ownership of some digital asset. 
This state might change overtime.
Say you show a receipt that you have bought some item, it is not easy to verify if this receipt is still valid and up-to-date, until the old receipt is enforced to be destroyed during transactions. 
In digital world, data is born to be copied, not destroyable.
So, blockchain is to save the world here: an up-to-date state is acknowledged by the consensus and decides who owns the item.

---

The data type in case I is append-only: one data item does not affect the validity of another data item.

For example, an evidance blockchain records how many steps you run. Record 10k-Step does not invalidate the record 1k-step, both record will be valid.
If the user wants to claim 10-k step reward, it only needs to show the 10k record and ignore the 1k one, and the platform cannot deny 10k with 1k anyway.
If the user is reasonable, it will not use 1k record if it already has 10k record.

Who will store the credential: those with interest.
If the holder loses the credential such as JWT, it loses access or utility.
Resonable people will find the right place to save the credentials, which is not neccessary to be a blockchain.

>In many applications, especially those with a limited number of participants, maintaining credentials (like JWTs) and ensuring their secure storage is sufficient. Users have a vested interest in preserving these credentials, and systems can be designed to allow for efficient verification without a blockchain.

If there are specific very limited number of participants in your application, you can even run a small conensus protocol among (probably between) these parties, instead of leveraing public Satoshi protocol to embed PoW in your data.
You can save a list of very succinct ping-pong signatures in a cheap and realiable database.

That disproves consortium blockchains, in some use cases, modestly.

Advice

Go to check if your smart contract is unnecessary.
If your smart contract is nothing more than the trival 1-state or 2-state FSM, maybe reconsider if blockchain is necessary in your system.

Remember: When the smart contract calls `sstore`, Ethereum charges you for mutable storage, not write-once read-only ROM! (It expects that you write it more times.)
